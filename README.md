# NetFlix-Movies-Data-Analysis

This analysis investigates Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office. The analyses is done to ascertain if the average duration of movies has been declining

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze data using Python to gain insights and answer questions. We use Jupyter Notebook to write our code and present our findings.

## Data

The data used in this project is a CSV file containing Netflix data. We import the data into our notebook and clean it as needed.

## Analysis

We start by exploring the data and understanding its structure. We then use various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to analyze the data and visualize our findings. We perform various data analysis tasks such as:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data exploration
- Data visualization
- Data modeling and prediction

## Results

We present our findings in this section using various visualizations such as graphs, charts, and tables. We also provide insights and interpretations of the data and answer the questions we set out to explore in the introduction.

## Conclusion

We conclude the project by summarizing our findings, discussing the limitations of our analysis, and suggesting areas for further research.
